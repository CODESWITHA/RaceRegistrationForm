<h1> <strong>Race Registration Form </strong></h1>
  
  <p> I created this Race Registration Form using <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>. My main goal of this project was to enhance my CSS skills </p>
<p> I've had experience on using HTML and CSS, however I wanted to create a simple project to reinforce what I have previously learned and to see if I could learn some new features in CSS. </p>
  <p> One of the biggest problem I faced in this project was moving the radio inputs to the center. I wrapped each individual radio input in a <em> **<div>** </em> and set the .class to<em> ** display: inline-flex**</em> so the radio inputs lay out in a row instead of the default block style a div would have Then I spaced them out using <em> padding.</em> </p>
  
  <p> To make my code look cleaner I grouped several ID with the same parent so have the same css styling, separated by commas.
