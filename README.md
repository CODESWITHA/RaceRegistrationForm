<h1> Race Registration Form </h1>
  
  <p> I created this Race Registration Form using HTML and CSS My main goal of this project was to enhance my CSS skills </p>
<p> I've had experience on using html and css however I wanted to create a simple project to reinforce what I have previously learned and to see if I could learn some new features on css. </p>
  <p> One of the biggest problem I faced in this project was moving the radio inputs to the center. I wrapped each individual radio input in a <div> and set the .class to <emphasis>** display: inline-flex**</emphasis> so the radio inputs lay out in a row instead of the default block style a <div> would have Then I spaced them out using padding
  As I was using other inputs I used an ID specifically for the radio input elements as the layout was going to styled differently than the other inputs. I also used ** margin-left: 43% ** to give each of the inputs space
